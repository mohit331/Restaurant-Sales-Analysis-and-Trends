#Excel Project - Restaurant-Sales-Analysis-and-Trends
I recently completed a data analytics project focused on restaurant operations, where I had the opportunity to dive deep into sales data to uncover insights and trends.

Project Highlights:
Analyzed transaction data to identify peak hours and popular menu items.
Created a detailed pivot table to visualize order frequencies by day and item.
Examined pricing strategies by categorizing menu items and evaluating their performance.
Leveraged tools like Excel for data cleaning, pivot analysis, and dashboard creation.

Key Insights:
Top Sellers: Cheeseburger and French Fries dominated sales, especially during lunchtime.
Peak Days: Mondays and Tuesdays saw the highest order volumes, challenging the notion of "slow Mondays."
Meal Trends: Lunch consistently outperformed other meal times, driving the majority of the sales.
This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my analytical skills to a real-world scenario, and I'm eager to take on more challenges in the data space!
